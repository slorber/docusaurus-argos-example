# Argos tests

This page presents examples of things that are likely to change between MDX v1 and v2.

Argos should report these cases when you upgrade.

## Remark-directives

In MDX v2, syntax such as `:xyz` is now interpreted as a [Markdown directive](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive).

You'll need to escape the `:` if you really want Docusaurus to display `:xyz`, see the difference:

- Without escaping :xyz
- With escaping: \:xyz

## Extra paragraphs

In MDX v2, JSX line breaks are more likely to create extra paragraphs.

```html title="MDX example"
<div style={{ border: "solid" }}>abc</div>

<div style={{ border: "solid" }}>
  def
</div>
```

See for example how this is rendered:

<div style={{ border: "solid" }}>abc</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div style={{ border: "solid" }}>
  def
</div>
